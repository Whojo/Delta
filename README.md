This project was forked from https://github.com/oricou/delta.
It was part of course named: "Python for Big Data".

You can see a shorten version of it here: https://delta.lrde.epita.fr/.
It shares three examples of Data Extraction, Data Wrangling & Data Analysis (in French):

* Energy prices](https://delta.lrde.epita.fr/energies): compares the consumer price of different energies in France
* [Birth rate / income](https://delta.lrde.epita.fr/population): a classic example showing the fall in birth rates around the world and the growth in income
* [Daily deaths](https://delta.lrde.epita.fr/deces): illustrates the evolution of deaths in France over the last 50 years.

My work focused on the comparison of high speed train developments in France and its impact on the population of the cities concerned.
